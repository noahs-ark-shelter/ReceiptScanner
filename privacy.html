    <h1>Privacy Policy for ReceiptScanner</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 7, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to ReceiptScanner ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the ReceiptScanner web application (the "Service"). Our Service is designed to help you scan paper receipts, extract data from them using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, and then store the receipt images and extracted data in your personal Google Drive and Google Sheets accounts, as directed by you.</p>
    <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Handle</h2>
    <p>We access and process the following types of information to provide the Service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Receipt Images You Provide:</strong> When you use the Service, you will upload images of your receipts. These images are processed to extract data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Extracted from Receipts:</strong> This includes text and figures recognized from your receipt images by Google's Cloud Vision API, such as vendor names, dates, item descriptions, and total amounts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Information for Google Services Integration (with your explicit permission):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Account Information:</strong> To enable the Service to interact with your Google Drive and Google Sheets, you will need to authenticate using your Google Account (Google Sign-In). We will receive basic profile information as permitted by your Google account settings and the permissions you grant (e.g., your email address, name) solely for the purpose of identifying you within the application.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Drive Access:</strong> With your explicit permission, the Service will upload the receipt images you provide to your designated folder within your Google Drive. The Service only accesses Google Drive to create these files as initiated by you and does not access other files or folders.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Sheets Access:</strong> With your explicit permission, the Service will write the data extracted from your receipts into a Google Sheet in your Google Account. The Service only accesses Google Sheets to add this data to the spreadsheet you designate or one created by the application at your direction.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect any other personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it to us (e.g., by sending us an email for support).</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and operate the core functionalities of the ReceiptScanner Service (i.e., allow you to upload receipts, process them via OCR, and transfer data to your Google Drive and Sheets).</li>
        <li>To authenticate your access to the Service using your Google Account.</li>
        <li>To facilitate the storage of your receipt images in your Google Drive, as you direct.</li>
        <li>To facilitate the recording of extracted receipt data into your Google Sheets, as you direct.</li>
        <li>To respond to your inquiries or support requests if you contact us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. Your information is shared only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>With Google:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Receipt images are sent to Google's Cloud Vision API for OCR processing. Google's handling of this data is governed by their terms and privacy policies. We recommend you review <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/data-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Cloud Vision API Data Usage FAQs</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                <li>When you authorize the Service to access your Google Drive and Google Sheets, you are granting permission directly to Google's services through the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Our Service acts as a client to these services on your behalf.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Beyond these scenarios, the receipt images and extracted data are intended to be stored directly within your own Google Drive and Google Sheets accounts, under your control.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>The ReceiptScanner web application is a client-side application. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Receipt Images and Extracted Data:</strong> The Service facilitates the transfer of your receipt images and extracted data directly to your personal Google Drive and Google Sheets accounts. The storage and security of this data within your Google Drive and Google Sheets are governed by Google's security practices and your Google account settings. We do not store your receipt images or extracted data on our own servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Security:</strong> We take reasonable steps to ensure that the data transmission between your browser and the Google APIs is secure (e.g., using HTTPS). However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Tokens:</strong> Access tokens for Google services are handled by your browser as part of the OAuth 2.0 flow and are used to make API requests on your behalf. They are not stored by us long-term.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access, Modification, and Deletion:</strong> You can access, modify, or delete your receipt images and extracted data directly from your Google Drive and Google Sheets accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Revoking Permissions:</strong> You can revoke ReceiptScanner's access to your Google Account at any time by visiting your Google Account permissions page: <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>. Revoking permissions will prevent the Service from accessing your Google Drive or Google Sheets from that point forward.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
